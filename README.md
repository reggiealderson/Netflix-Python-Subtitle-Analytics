# Netflix Python Subtitle Analytics
 I have combined Netflix subtitle data with python code to create an analytics application, helping people improve their fluency in a foreign language.

Refer to app.py for the front-end Streamlit orientated code.
Refer to analyser.py for the predominate backend code, which processes Netflix subtitle data (currently located in the 'German' folder) using Natural Language Processing frameworks Spacy & Textacy.
