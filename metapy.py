<p>
Hello ðŸ‘‹, my name is <strong>Reggie</strong>, 
and I have combined Netflix subtitle data with python code to create an analytics application, helping people improve their fluency in a foreign language.
</p>
<p>
As a user of this application you simply select the show you want to watch, and a script will run in the background to calculate the most common occuring phrases 
featured in that show.
These phrases are then displayed in an orderly fashion, allowing you to rehearse them before watching each episode at a pace that suits you, 
with the confidence of knowing how often each phrase occurs throughout the series.
